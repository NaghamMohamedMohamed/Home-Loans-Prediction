# Home-Loans-Prediction

A housing finance company offers interest-free home loans to customers. When a customer applies for a home loan, the company validates the customer's eligibility for a loan before making a decision.

So, the the linear regression model was used for the loan status ( whether the client will repay it or not ). In case of repaying process approval, the logistic regression model was used to predict the loan amout.
